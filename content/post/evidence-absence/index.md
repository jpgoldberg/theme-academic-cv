The problem with this sort of question is that what we can conclude from absense of evidence depends on things about the specific claims and our ability to test them. Consider two claim, C1 and C2 for which there is no direct evidence.

C1: There is a family of elephants living in the refrigerator in my kitchen.

C2: There are some stars with planets orbiting them in the Sculptor galaxy.

There is no evidence for either of those claims, but it is reasonable to conclude C1 is almost certainly false and C2 is almost certainly true. And indeed for C1 we correctly treat the absense of evidence as evidence of absense, while for C2 we do not treat the absense of evidence as evidence of absense.

## Different prior probabilities

There are two things that make C1 and C2 different from each other. The first is that C1 is highly implausible even before we consider evidence. That is it has a low prior probability. C2, on the other hand, has a very high prior probability. While we don't have the tech to detect planets in the Sculptor galaxy, we have good reasont to believe it is a galaxy like ours, and ours has lots of planets.

## Possibible evidence

If C1 were true, there would be lots of evidence for it (e.g, elephant footprints in the butter). Elephants are really big and visiable in the kind of space we'd need to search. Quite simply we know what sorts of evidence we would expect to observe if C1 were true.

With C2 we don't have that. The ability to detect planets outside of our solar system in our own galaxy is new. The ability to detect planets in a galaxy as far away as the Sculpter galaxy is not somethng that we have.

When I look in my kitchen I can immediately determine that there are no elephants living there. But when someone looks at the Sculptor galaxy (I don't have a good enough telescope to do so), what they shows no evidence either way about the presense or abstance of planets. What we see is the same whether there are or aren't.

## No simple formula

So a general statement of "absence of evidence is (or is not) evidence of absense" is just not something we can adopt as a principle.

## Applying to claims about the existence of a god

At this point, let me add a third claim for which there is no evidence.

C3: There is a family of African elephants living on the 4th planet oribiting the the millionth brighetest star in the Sculptor galaxy.

This is like C2 in that we just aren't
